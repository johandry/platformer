<!--
A great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed report when you
encounter an issue. We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report,
and will thank you for it!

To differentiate an bug from a feature request use the appropriate label and is
not mandatory but encouraged to use the prefix `[Feature]` or `[Fix]` in the
issue title.

If you are reporting a new issue, make sure that we do not have any duplicates
already open. You can ensure this by searching the issue list for this
repository. If there is a duplicate, please close your issue and add a comment
to the existing issue instead, you can use the "subscribe" button to get
notified on updates. Do not leave random "+1" or "I have this too" comments, as
they only clutter the discussion, and don't help resolving it. However, if you
have ways to reproduce the issue or have additional information that may help
resolving the issue, please leave a comment.

If you suspect your issue is a bug, please edit your issue description to
include the BUG REPORT INFORMATION shown below. If you fail to provide this
information within 7 days, we cannot debug your issue and will close it. We
will, however, reopen it if you later provide the information.

When reporting issues, always include the steps required to reproduce the
problem if possible and applicable. This information will help us review and fix
your issue faster. When sending lengthy log-files, consider posting them as a
gist (https://gist.github.com). Don't forget to remove sensitive data from your
logfiles before posting (you can replace those parts with "REDACTED").
